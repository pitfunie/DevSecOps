Infrastructure as Code Using Terraform
Infrastructure as code (IaC) frameworks, such as HashiCorp Terraform, make cloud provisioning scalable and straightforward by leveraging automation and code. Defining our cloud infrastructure in code simplifies repetitive DevOps tasks and gives us a versioned, auditable source of truth for the state of an environment.

Terraform is useful for defining resource configurations and interacting with APIs in a codified, stateful manor. Any updates we want to make, such as adding more instances or changes to a configuration, can be handled by Terraform.

For example, the following Terraform resource block defines a simple AWS S3 bucket:

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "data" {
  bucket     = "my_bucket_name"
  acl        = "public-read-write"
}

After performing terraform init, we can provision an S3 bucket with the following command:


terraform apply


Any changes made to the resource definition within a .tf file, such as adding tags or changing the acl, can be pushed with the terraform apply command.

Another benefit of using Terraform to define infrastructure is that code can be scanned for misconfigurations before the resource is created. This allows for security controls to be integrated into the development process, preventing issues from being introduced, deployed and exploited.
